## Abstract (500 characters)

A new generation of algorithms is addressing the fundamental challenge of how to exhaustively explore all possible scenarios for simulation of dynamical systems under model uncertainties. Moreover, deep neural networks take an increasing role in control and safety-critical applications, although it is not known how to guarantee that they will behave correctly and safely under all circumstances. This minisymposium will host applications of set-based techniques and global optimization in Julia.

    - The Finite Element Method (FEM) is the gold standard for the numerical simulation in transient solid mechanics problems. Several time integration algorithms have been developed in recent decades, however it is still a challenging problem to completely describe the family of dynamically feasible behaviors under given sets of initial states. In this talk we present a different, set-based approach motivated by recent advances in the field of Reachability Analysis (RA): by propagating the sets given in the problem formulation, we obtain flowpipes, unions of sets enclosing the infinitely many solutions of the problems. We show that the full potential of RA in solid mechanics problems is yet to be explored.

    - Description of Talk:

        - We review our recent work on the EAGODynamicOptimizer.jl and DynamicBounds.jl packages which extended the EAGO.jl nonconvex optimizer to address formulations containing embedded dynamical systems. We highlight a series of approaches for constructing the requisite convex and concave relaxations of differential equations in the original decision space and discuss the use of such techniques in a global optimization context. These methods may readily be composed with existing McCormick relaxations approaches which allows for the solution of general nonlinear formulations to certified global optimality. Use cases relevant to hybrid data-driven process modeling, parameter estimation, and worst-case robust design are discussed.
